this code implements three approachs to the joseph problem

n: the number of people.
m: the value when m appears in the process.

1. joseph(n,m): return the result in a recursive way
2. joseph_iter(n,m): return the result in a iterative way
3. joseph_simu(n,m): return the result by simulating the whole process using an                      array.
